# Vuforia-Scenekit-UserDefinedTargets

**DISCLAIMER: This repo is a work in progress**

I'm attempting to deconstruct the Vuforia sample app and replicate something my other [Vuforia - Swift - Scenekit project](https://github.com/NicoHinderling/VuforiaScenekit-Swift-Example/), except this time with User Defined Targets rather than pre-determined Image Targets.


**This project is currently on hold**
